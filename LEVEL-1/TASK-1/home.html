            Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. 
            Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines 
            vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.

            Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain
            foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. 
            A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India.

            Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and 
            Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.
            Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia.
